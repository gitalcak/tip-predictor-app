# 🚖 NYC Taxi Tip Predictor App

This Streamlit app predicts whether a taxi rider is likely to leave a **generous tip** based on features like trip distance, time of day, and more. It's built using a machine learning model trained on a simplified version of the **2017 TLC Taxi dataset**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To help taxi drivers identify potentially generous tippers before or during the ride using a lightweight prediction tool based on patterns in historical data.

## 🧠 Model Information

- **Model Type**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Training Set**: 2017 TLC Yellow Taxi Data (subset)  
- **Target Variable**: `generous` (1 = above-average tip, 0 = otherwise)  
- **Selected Features**:
  - `passenger_count`
  - `avg_distance` (average distance between pickup & dropoff)
  - Time of day: `am_rush`, `daytime`, `pm_rush`, `nighttime`
  - Day of week: `day_monday`, `day_tuesday`, etc.
  - Month: `month_jan`, `month_feb`, etc.

## 🛠 Features

- Interactive form to input trip details
- Predicts whether the customer is likely to leave a generous tip
- Designed to be fast, minimal, and easy to use

### Notes
- The dataset was filtered to include only credit card payments for consistency.
- This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It does not make real-time predictions and is not intended for deployment in commercial settings.
- Ethical considerations were acknowledged but simplified for the scope of this prototype.
- This dataset is also introduced in Google's Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Program.
